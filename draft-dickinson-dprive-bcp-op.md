.# Abstract
This document presents operational, policy and security considerations for DNS
operators who choose to offer DNS Privacy services.

This document also presents a framework to assist writers of DNS Privacy Policy
and Practices Statements (analogous to DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) Policies
and DNSSEC Practice Statements described in [@RFC6841]).

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

[NOTE: This document is submitted to the IETF for initial review and for
feedback on the best forum for future versions of this document. Initial
considerations for DoH [@!I-D.ietf-doh-dns-over-https] are included here in
anticipation of that draft progressing to be an RFC but further analysis is
required.]

The Domain Name System (DNS) is at the core of the Internet; almost every
activity on the Internet starts with a DNS query (and often several). However
the DNS was not originally designed with strong security or privacy mechanisms.
A number of developments have taken place in recent years which aim to increase
the privacy of the DNS system and these are now seeing some deployment. This
latest evolution of the DNS presents new challenges to operators and this
document attempts to provide an overview of considerations for privacy focussed
DNS services.

In recent years there has also been an increase in the availability of "open
resolvers" [@?I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis] which users may prefer to use
instead of the default network resolver because they offer a specific feature
(e.g. good reachability, encrypted transport, strong privacy policy, filtering
(or lack of), etc.). These open resolvers have tended to be at the forefront of
adoption of privacy related enhancements but it is anticipated that operators of
other resolver services will follow.

Whilst protocols that encrypt DNS messages on the wire provide protection
against certain attacks, the resolver operator still has (in principle) full
visibility of the query data and transport identifiers for each user. Therefore,
a trust relationship exists. The ability of the operator to provide a
transparent, well documented, and secure privacy service will likely serve as a
major differentiating factor for privacy conscious users if they make an
active selection of which resolver to use.
<mark>(*RvRD: I'm wondering whether we should differentiate between "indifferent users"
for whom this trust relationship is implicit, and "privacy-conscious users", that
make an explicit trust choice; this may prove relevant in the context of e.g.
the GDPR as it relates to consent.*)</mark>

It should also be noted that the choice of a user to configure a single resolver
(or a fixed set of resolvers) and an encrypted transport to use in all network
environments has both advantages and disadvantages. For example the user has a
clear expectation of which resolvers have visibility of their query data however
this resolver/transport selection may provide an added mechanism to track them
as they move across network environments. Commitments from operators to minimise
such tracking are also likely to play a role in users selection of resolver.

More recently the global legislative landscape with regard to personal data
collection, retention, and pseudonymization has seen significant activity with
differing requirements active in different jurisdictions. For example the user
of a service and the service itself may be in jurisdictions with conflicting
legislation. It is an untested area that simply using a DNS resolution service
constitutes consent from the user for the operator to process their query data.
The impact of recent legislative changes on data pertaining to the users of both
Internet Service Providers and DNS open resolvers is not fully understood at the
time of writing.
<mark>(*RvRD: I can share the short privacy statement SURFnet will use for its resolvers*)</mark>

This document has two main goals:

* To provide operational and policy guidance related to DNS over encrypted
  transports and to outline recommendations for data handling for operators of
  DNS privacy services.

* To introduce the DNS Privacy Policy and Practice Statement (DPPPS) and present
  a framework to assist writers of this document. A DPPPS is a document that an
  operator can publish outlining their operational practices and commitments
  with regard to privacy thereby providing a means for clients to evaluate the
  privacy properties of a given DNS privacy service. In particular, the
  framework identifies the elements that should be considered in formulating a
  DPPPS. This document does not, however, define a particular Policy or Practice
  Statement, nor does it seek to provide legal advice or recommendations as to
  the contents.

Community knowledge about operational practices can change quickly, and
experience shows that a Best Current Practice (BCP) document about privacy and
security is a point-in-time statement. Readers are advised to seek out any
errata or updates that apply to this document.

# Scope

Whilst [@!RFC7626] describes the general privacy issues and risks associated
with the use of the DNS by Internet users, this document is limited in scope to
best practice considerations for the provision of DNS privacy services by
servers (recursive resolvers) to clients (stub resolvers or forwarders). Privacy
considerations specifically from the perspective of an end user, or those for
operators of authoritative nameservers are out of scope.

This document includes (but is not limited to) considerations in the following
areas (taken from [@!RFC7626]):

1. Data on the wire between a client and a server
2. Data "at rest" on a server (e.g. in logs)
3. Data sent onwards from the server (either on the wire or shared with a third
party)

Whilst the issues raised here are targeted at those operators who choose to
offer a DNS privacy service, considerations for areas 2 and 3 could equally
apply to operators who only offer DNS over unencrypted transports but who would
like to align with privacy best practice.

# Documents

There are various documents that describe protocol changes that have the
potential to either increase or decrease the privacy of the DNS. Note this does
not imply that some documents are good or bad, better or worse, just that (for
example) some features may bring functional benefits at the price of a reduction
in privacy and conversely some features increase privacy with an accompanying
increase in complexity. A selection of the most relevant documents are listed in
the following three sections for reference, however, this is neither an
exhaustive list nor a definitive statement on the characteristic of the
document.

QUESTION: Should this section be an appendix?
<mark>(*RvRD: I think it makes sense to move this to an appendix*)</mark>

## Potential increases in DNS privacy

These documents are limited in scope to communications between stub
clients and recursive resolvers:

* 'Specification for DNS over Transport Layer Security (TLS)' [@!RFC7858],
  referred to here as 'DNS-over-TLS'.
* 'DNS over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)' [@!RFC8094], referred to
  here as 'DNS-over-DTLS'. Note that this document has the Category of
  Experimental.
* 'DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)' [@!I-D.ietf-doh-dns-over-https] referred to here as DoH.
* 'Usage Profiles for DNS over TLS and DNS over DTLS' [@!RFC8310]
* 'The EDNS(0) Padding Option' [@!RFC7830] and 'Padding Policy for EDNS(0)'
  [@!I-D.ietf-dprive-padding-policy]

These documents apply to recursive to authoritative DNS but are relevant when
considering the operation of a recursive server:

* 'DNS Query Name Minimisation to Improve Privacy' [@!RFC7816] referred to here
  as 'QNAME minimization'

## Potential decreases in DNS privacy

These documents relate to functionality that could provide increased tracking of
user activity as a side effect:

* 'Client Subnet in DNS Queries' [@!RFC7871]
* 'Domain Name System (DNS) Cookies' [@!RFC7873])
* 'Transport Layer Security (TLS) Session Resumption without Server-Side State'
  [@!RFC5077] referred to here as simply TLS session resumption.
* 'A DNS Packet Capture Format' [@?I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-capture-format]
* Passive DNS [@?I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis]

Note that depending on the specifics of the implementation
[@!I-D.ietf-doh-dns-over-https] may also provide increased tracking.

## Related operational documents

* 'DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation Requirements' [@!RFC7766]
* 'Operational requirements for DNS-over-TCP'
  [@?I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-tcp-requirements]
* 'The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option' [@!RFC7828]
* 'DNS Stateful Operations' [@!I-D.ietf-dnsop-session-signal]

# Terminology

The key words described in [@!RFC8174] are not used in this document because the
intention here is not to prescribe policy but to provide indicators of best
practice.

Privacy terminology is as described in Section 3 of [@!RFC6973].

DNS terminology is as described in [@?I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis] with one
modification: we use the definition of Privacy-enabling DNS
server taken from [@RFC8310]:

* Privacy-enabling DNS server: A DNS server (most likely a full-service
  resolver) that implements DNS-over-TLS [@RFC7858], and may optionally
  implement DNS-over-DTLS [@RFC8094]. The server should also offer at least one
  of the credentials described in Section 8 and implement the (D)TLS profile
  described in Section 9.
  
  TODO: Update the definition of Privacy-enabling DNS server in
  [@?I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis] to be complete and also include DoH, then
  reference that here.

* DPPPS: DNS Privacy Policy and Practice Statement, see
  (#dns-privacy-policy-and-practice-statement).

* DNS privacy service: The service that is offered via a privacy-enabling DNS
  server and is documented either in an informal statement of policy and
  practice with regard to users privacy or a formal DPPPS.

# Recommendations for DNS privacy services

We describe three classes of actions that operators of DNS privacy
services can take:

* Threat mitigation for well understood and documented privacy threats to the
  users of the service and in some cases to the operators of the service.
* Optimisation of privacy services from an operational or management perspective
* Additional options that could further enhance the privacy and usability of the
  service

For DNS Privacy services to be considered minimally compliant with best
practices they should implement all the threat mitigations described here.

TODO: Some of the threats listed in the following sections are taken directly
from Section 5 of RFC6973, some are just standalone descriptions, we need to go
through all of them and see if we can use the RFC6973 threats where possible
and make them consistent.


## On the wire between client and server

In this section we consider both data on the wire and the service provided to
the client.

### Transport recommendations

Threats: 

* Surveillance: Passive surveillance of traffic on the wire
* Intrusion: Active injection of spurious data or traffic

Mitigations:

A DNS privacy service can mitigate these threats by providing service over one
or more of the following transports

* DNS-over-TLS [@RFC7858]
* DoH [@I-D.ietf-doh-dns-over-https]

Additional options:

* A DNS privacy service can also be provided over DNS-over-DTLS [@RFC8094],
  however note that this is an Experimental specification.

It is noted that DNS privacy service might be provided over IPSec, DNSCrypt
or VPNs. However, use of these transports for DNS are not standardized and any
discussion of best practice for providing such service is out of scope for this
document.

### Authentication of DNS privacy services

Threats: 

* Surveillance and Intrusion: Active attacks that can redirect traffic to
  rogue servers

Mitigations:

DNS privacy services should ensure clients can authenticate the server. Note
that this, in effect, commits the DNS privacy service to a public identity users
will trust.

When using DNS-over-TLS [@!RFC8310] clients that select a 'Strict Privacy' usage
profile (to mitigate the threat of active attack on the client) require the
ability to authenticate the DNS server. To enable this, DNS privacy services
that offer DNS-over-TLS should provide credentials in the form of either X.509
certificates, SPKI pinsets or TLSA records.

When offering DoH [@I-D.ietf-doh-dns-over-https], HTTPS requires authentication
of the server as part of the protocol.

Optimisations:

DNS privacy services can also consider the following capabilities/options:

* As recommended in [@RFC8310] providing DANE TLSA records for the nameserver
  * In particular, the service could provide TLSA records such that
    authenticating solely via the PKIX infrastructure can be avoided.
* Implementing [@I-D.ietf-tls-dnssec-chain-extension]
  * This can decrease the latency of connection setup to the server and remove
    the need for the client to perform meta-queries to obtain and validate the
    DANE records.

#### Certificate management 

Anecdotal evidence to date highlights the management of certificates as one of
the more challenging aspects for operators of traditional DNS resolvers that
choose to additionally provide a DNS privacy service as management of such
credentials is new to those DNS operators.

Threats: 

* Invalid certificates, resulting in an unavailable service.
* Mis-identification of a server by a client e.g. typos in URLs or
  authentication domain names

Mitigations:

It is recommended that operators:

* Choose a short, memorable authentication name for their service
* Automate the generation and publication of certificates
* Monitor certificates to prevent accidental expiration of certificates
* Consider re-use of the public/private keypair in the case of a service
  provided through DNS-over-TLS, as trust pin management by users is undefined,
  and may be hard to troubleshoot for both users and operators of a DNS privcy
  service (*RvRD: do we think it makes sense to add this?*) (Sara->RVRD: SPKI
  pinset use is defined, but increasingly shunned by operators so I haven
  mentioned it here...) <mark>(*RvRD: should we then more explicitly 
  recommend steering clear of SPKI pinsets?*)</mark>

TODO: Can we provide references for certificate management best practice, for
example Section 6.5 of RFC7525?


### Protocol recommendations

#### DNS-over-TLS

Threats:

* Known attacks on TLS (TODO: add a reference)
* Traffic analysis (TODO: add a reference)
* Potential for client tracking via transport identifiers
* Blocking of well known ports (e.g. 853 for DNS-over-TLS)

Mitigations:

In the case of DNS-over-TLS, TLS profiles from Section 9 and the Countermeasures 
to DNS Traffic Analysis from section 11.1 of [@!RFC8310] provide strong mitigations. This includes but is not limited to:

* Adhering to [@RFC7525]
* Implementing only (D)TLS 1.2 or later as specified in [@RFC8310]
* Implementing EDNS(0) Padding [@RFC7830]
* Clients should not be required to use TLS session resumption [@!RFC5077],
  Domain Name System (DNS) Cookies [@!RFC7873] or HTTP Cookies [@RFC6265].
* A DNS-over-TLS privacy service on both port 853 and 443. We note that this
  practice may require revision when DoH becomes more widely deployed, because
  of the potential use of the same ports for two incompatible types of service.

Optimisations:

* Management of TLS connections to optimise performance for clients using either
  * [@!RFC7766] and EDNS(0) Keepalive [@!RFC7828] and/or 
  * DNS Stateful Operations [@!I-D.ietf-dnsop-session-signal]
  
Additional options that providers may consider:

* Offer a .onion [@RFC7686] service endpoint

#### DoH

TODO: fill this in, some overlap with DNS-over-TLS but we need to address DoH
specific ones if possible


### Availability

Threats:

* A failed DNS privacy service could force the user to switch providers,
fallback to cleartext or accept no DNS service for the outage.

Mitigations:

A DNS privacy service must be engineered for high availability. Particular care
should to be taken to protect DNS privacy services against denial-of-service
attacks, as experience has shown that unavailability of DNS resolving because of
attacks is a significant motivation for users to switch services.

TODO: Add reference for work by Roland's student.

### Service options

Threats: 

* Unfairly disadvantaging users of the privacy service with respect to the
  services available. This could force the user to switch providers, fallback to
  cleartext or accept no DNS service for the outage.

Mitigations:

A DNS privacy service should deliver the same level of service offered on
un-encrypted channels in terms of such options as filtering (or lack of), DNSSEC
validation, etc. 


### Limitations of using a pure TLS proxy

Optimisation:

Some operators may choose to implement DNS-over-TLS using a TLS proxy (e.g.
[nginx](https://nginx.org/), [haproxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) or
[stunnel](https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01386/0/DNS-over-TLS.html)) in front of
a DNS nameserver because of proven robustness and capacity when handling large
numbers of client connections, load balancing capabilities and good tooling.
Currently, however, because such proxies typically have no specific handling of
DNS as a protocol over TLS or DTLS using them can restrict traffic management at
the proxy layer and at the DNS server. For example, all traffic received by a
nameserver behind such a proxy will appear to originate from the proxy and DNS
techniques such as ACLs, RRL or DNS64 will be hard or impossible to implement in
the nameserver.

Operators may choose to use a DNS aware proxy such as dnsdist. 


## Data at rest on the server

### Data handling

Threats:

* Surveillance
* Stored data compromise
* Correlation
* Identification
* Secondary use
* Disclosure

* Contravention of legal requirements not to process user data?

Mitigations:

The following are common activities for DNS service operators and in all cases
should be minimised or completely avoided if possible for DNS privacy services.
If data is retained it should be encrypted and either aggregated,
pseudonymized or anonymized whenever possible. In general the principle of data minimization described in [@!RFC6973] should be applied.

* Transient data (e.g. that is used for real time monitoring and threat analysis
  which might be held only memory) should be retained for the shortest possible
  period deemed operationally feasible.
* The retention period of DNS traffic logs should be only those required to
  sustain operation of the service and, to the extent that such exists, meet
  regulatory requirements.
* DNS privacy services should not track users except for the particular purpose
  of detecting and remedying technically malicious (e.g. DoS) or anomalous use
  of the service.
* Data access should be minimised to only those personal who require access to
  perform operational duties.

### IP address pseudonymization and anonymization methods

There is active discussion in the space of effective pseudonymization of
personal data in DNS query logs. To-date this has focussed on
pseudonymization of client IP addresses, however there are as yet no
standards for this that are unencumbered by patents. This section briefly
references some known methods in this space at the time of writing.

#### ipcipher

[@ipcipher-spec] is a pseudonymization technique which encrypts IPv4 and IPv6
addresses such that any address encrypts to a valid address. At the time of
writing the specification is under review and may be the subject of a future
IETF draft. 

NOTE: There are some significant security concerns about the use of ipcipher
that have been voiced by the ipcipher authors and its inclusion here should be
reviewed.

#### Bloom filters

There is also on-going work in the area of using Bloom filters as a
privacy-enhancing technology for DNS monitoring [@DNS-bloom-filter]. The goal of
this work is to allow operators to identify so-called Indicators of Compromise
(IOCs) originating from specific subnets without storing information about, or
be able to monitor the DNS queries of an individual user.


### Pseudonymization and anonymization of other correlation data

TODO: Discuss tracking mechanisms other than IP address (DNS and HTTP cookies,
Session resumption, etc.)

### Cache snooping

Threats: 

* Profiling of client queries by malicious third parties

Mitigations: 

TODO: Describe techniques to defend against cache snooping


## Data sent onwards from the server

In this section we consider both data sent on the wire in upstream queries and
data shared with third parties.

### Protocol recommendations

Threats: 

* Transmission of identifying data upstream.

Mitigations:

As specified in [@!RFC8310] for DNS-over-TLS but applicable to any DNS Privacy services the server should:

* Implement QNAME minimisation [@!RFC7816]
* Honour a SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH set to 0 in a query containing the EDNS(0)
  Client Subnet (ECS) option and not send an ECS option in upstream queries.

If operators do offer a service that sends the ECS options upstream they should make clear in any policy statement what prefix length they send and any policy for which upstream servers they send the option to (e.g. all, whitelist).

<mark>(*RvRD: note: I have a bachelor student working on this, who has been looking at what are good prefix sizes to e.g. geo-locate a client to a country or continent; will share results when available. I'm considering following up on his work with a paper at some point to help the discussion about ECS along.*)</mark>

Optimisations:

* The server should either 
  * not use the ECS option in upstream queries at all, or
  * offer alternative services, one that sends ECS and one that does not.

Additional options:

* Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache [@RFC8198] to reduce the number of
  queries to authoritative servers to increase privacy.
* Run a copy of the root zone on loopback [@RFC7706] to avoid making queries to
  the root servers that might leak information.

### Client query obfuscation

Additional options:

Since queries from recursive resolvers to authoritative servers are performed
using cleartext (at the time of writing), resolver services need to consider the
extent to which they may be directly leaking information about their client
community via these upstream queries and what they can do to mitigate this
further. Note, that even when all the relevant techniques described above are
employed there may still be attacks possible, e.g.
[@Pitfalls-of-DNS-Encryption]. For example, a resolver with a very small
community of users risks exposing data in this way and OUGHT obfuscate this
traffic by mixing it with 'generated' traffic to make client characterisation
harder. The resolver could also employ aggressive pre-fetch techniques as a
further measure to counter traffic analysis.

At the time of writing there are no standardized or widely recognized techniques
to preform such obfuscation or bulk pre-fetches.

*RvRD: this is sort of a slippery slope; personally, I would advocate hiding in the masses (large DNS privacy services) over obfuscation techniques. The risk of a false sense of security is real I think. It sparked a thought though, perhaps multiple smaller DNS privacy services can somehow collaborate and randomly share upstream queries with each other, this might homogenize what their traffic looks like to the outside world. (I hope you get what I mean)*

*Sara->RVRD: I take your point about smaller services increasing the risk, but since this is advice for operators, not clients should we bring that up here?*

<mark>*RvRD->Sara: I think we should, because I can easily think of smaller organisations (say a university college) running a DNS privacy service, where they are an operator, just a small one; they could consider hiding in the masses by sending local traffic upstream to a larger resolver with a privacy policy that aligns with their own practices.*</mark>


### Data sharing


Threats:

* Surveillance
* Stored data compromise
* Correlation
* Identification
* Secondary use
* Disclosure

* Contravention of legal requirements not to process user data?

Mitigations:

Operators should not provide identifiable data to third-parties without explicit
consent from clients (we take the stance here that simply using the resolution
service itself does not constitute consent).

Operators should consider including specific guidelines for the collection of
aggregated and/or anonymised data for research purposes, within or outside of
their own organisation.

TODO: More on data for research vs operations... how to still motivate operators
to share anonymized data?

TODO: Guidelines for when consent is granted?

TODO: Applies to server data handling too.. could operators offer alternatives
services one that implies consent for data processing, one that doesn't?


# DNS privacy policy and practice statement

## Recommended contents of a DPPPS

<!-- Work out how to do a numbered, nested list in markdown! -->

1 Policy.

1.1 Recommendations. This section should explain, with reference to section 
      (#recommendations-for-dns-privacy-services) of this document which 
      recommendations the DNS privacy service employs.

1.2. Data handling. This section should explain, with reference to section 
       (#data-at-rest-on-the-server) 
       of this document the policy for gathering and disseminating information 
       collected by the DNS privacy service. 

1.2.1. Specify clearly what data (including whether it is aggregated, 
        pseudonymized or anonymized) is:

1.2.1.1. Collected and retained by the operator (and for how long)

1.2.1.2. Shared with, sold or rented to third-parties

1.2.2 Specify any exceptions to the above, for example technically malicious or
anomalous behaviour

1.2.3 Declare any third-party affiliations or funding

1.2.4 Whether user DNS data is correlated or combined with any other personal
    information held by the operator

2 Practice. This section should explain the current operational practices of the service.

2.1 Specify any temporary or permanent deviations from the policy for
    operational reasons

2.2 Provide specific details of which capabilities are provided on which 
      address and ports

2.3 Specify the authentication name to be used (if any)

2.4 Specify the SPKI pinsets to be used (if any) and policy for rolling keys

2.5 Provide a contact email address for the service

## Current privacy statements

NOTE: An analysis of these statements will clearly only provide a snapshot at
the time of writing. It is included in this version of the draft to provide a
basis for the assessment of the contents of the DPPPS and is expected to be
removed or substantially re-worked in a future version.

## Enforcement/accountability

Transparency reports may help with building user trust that operators adhere to their policies and practices.

Independent monitoring should be performed where possible of:

* ECS, QNAME minimisation, EDNS(0) padding, etc.
* Filtering
* Uptime
